#Orlando Mini Maker Faire Project Planner
#Super Hoop

##Objective
Create a spectacle to attract attention and bring people into our exhibit so that our members can talk about their projects and we can promote our new Tampa Hackerspace. The project should be portable and kid friendly for future use.

##Project Idea
Embed addressable LEDs into clear hula hoops and instrument them with a programmable microcontroller and sensors so that we can make games and use them creatively.

##Sensors
accelerometer
photo electric cell and/or color sensor
grip sensor
proximity sensors

##Applications / Games
Persistence of Vision display. Spin the hoops rapidly to make colorful displays

How high can you go? Compete to see who can toss the hoop the highest and safely catch it.

Ring toss. Two or more players toss the hoops between themselves. Take a step back at each successful catch and keep going to see how long you can keep the game going.

Ultimate Ring Golf: Play it like ultimate frisbee but use the rings.

Horseshoes: Rings instead of horseshoes. Same rules.

Fasted hoop: First one to spin their hoop hula style 100 rotations wins.

Billboard: Use a wireless controller to stream dynamic text that displays while spinning?
